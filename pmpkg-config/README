Poor Man's pkg-config

This is an implementation of pkg-config as a Bourne Shell script. For
proper functioning, it needs a basic set of Unix utilities, like sed,
grep and printf.

For installation instructions, just type make and you will get a list
of options. Included in this package is a slightly modified version of
pkg-config's original manual page. Most of it applies to pmpkg-config
too.

pmpkg-config should work on most Unix or Unix-like. It has been tested
on Linux 2.6.17.5 with bash 3.1.17, Minix 3.1.2a with bash 3.1.17 and
Minix 3.1.2a with its own /bin/sh, which is ash. If it does not work
for you, please send a detailed bug-report to <mpm-devel@lists.berlios.de>.
Please include at least the following:

* Operating system type and version
* Bourne shell type and version
* Command that you issued and its output
* Description of why that is wrong

Optionally you could include:

* Proper output of the real pkg-config
* The .pc file(s) it fails to handle correctly
