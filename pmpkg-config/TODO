* have Makefile adjust pmpkg-config.sh before installation:
    - replace version number with contents of VERSION
    - replace MYPREFIX with specified prefix=

Still missing:

* Report on Confict: fields in .pc files  (I have no packages on my system
  with that field set, so I cannot test it)

Known limitations:
(which will probably stay that way unless somebody sends a patch)

* Spaces in pathnames (e.g. --define-variable=prefix="/c/Program Files") do
  not work. So, this will probably not work very well on Windows, except
  for locales where "Program Files" is one word :)
* --uninstalled is unsupported
