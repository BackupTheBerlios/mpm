* implement --list-all
* change default search path(s) to directories relative to where pmpkg-config
  was installed (pkg-config behaviour)
* obey most pkg-config environment variables

After that, it's almost an exact copy

Still missing:

* Report on Confict: fields in .pc files  (I have no packages on my system
  with that field set, so I cannot test it)

Known limitations:

* Spaces in pathnames (e.g. --define-variable=prefix="/c/Program Files") do
  not work. So, this will probably not work very well on Windows, except
  for locales where "Program Files" is one word :)
* --uninstalled is unsupported
