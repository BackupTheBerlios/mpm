To build:

Have the Minix sources installed somewhere. Edit Makefile and have SOURCEPATH
point to the directory where src/commands/simple is located and SRCPATH to
where src is located. Or, you could just mount the 3.1.2a CDROM on /mnt.

If you do not want to include all applications, edit sources.sh.

The default stack/heap size is 4096kB. fsck needs at least that. It's also
comfortable for applications like diff, grep and sed but not strictly needed.
If you do not include fsck, you can decrease the value to 256kw by editting
the Makefile.

./gen.sh
make
make testlinks

./lazybox
./ls

You can check the amount of space saved by running ./savings.sh. It calculates
the sum of the currently installed binaries and compares it with the size of
lazybox. It seems to converge to 75% savings when you add more applications.


To install:

It is not advised to install lazybox on a running system. The Makefile supports
DESTDIR which should be used instead. The destination directory can either be
a directory tree that will be used to build a floppy image, or just a temporary
directory which can be used to manually replace current system utilities. There
are two install targets, install-sym and install-hard. The first one will
create symbolic links, the second one will create hard links. When you call
make install, the default is to create symbolic links. If you compile in only a
few applications, creating hard links might use less disk space.

make DESTDIR=/some/directory install
or
make DESTDIR=/some/directory install-sym
or
make DESTDIR=/some/directory install-hard

Currently, it does not differentiate between /bin, /usr/bin and /usr/lib (where
pwdauth is normally located). lazybox is installed in /bin (relative to
DESTDIR) and all links are placed in /bin too.
