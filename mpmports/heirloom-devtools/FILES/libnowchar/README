Heirloom's libwchar is incomplete and is missing a lot of functions that are
needed for these devtools. With libnowchar, all wchar_t stuff, including
function calls, is translated to normal, one-byte char.

This works for yacc and lex, but m4 depends too heavily on wchar_t really being
larger, so m4 is disabled for now until somebody implements proper wchar support
for Minix.
