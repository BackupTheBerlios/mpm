The bzlib library has been heavily stripped down. I removed all stdio code
by hand and all compression code that was somehow not removed by the linker.
(removing the stdio code instead of compiling with BZ_NO_STDIO was done to
decrease the size of the source code and increase readability for myself).
I also removed the small=1 code from bzlib.c and decompress.c. No matter
what you pass on to DecompressInit, it will always use the FAST method and
not the small and slow method.

Furthermore, I added an ifdef/endif pair and a few defines to bzlib_private.h
which can be used to disable CRC checking. Compile with -DNO_CRC to "enable".
Saves 1136 bytes, at the cost of no decompression errors detection.
