This directory contains several files that denote the status of all the
packages.

up-to-date      These packages are up to par with latest MPM developments
                and could be used as a basis for a release.

in-progress     The listed packages need to be updated to match the latest
                MPM developments. This could be a missing or incomplete
                attributes file or something regarding future development.

halted          Those listed as halted are not ported completely. Either
                because it is too much work, I lost interest, or both.

obsolete        Packages are considered obsolete if other packages contain
                the same binaries or libraries or if another port implements
                similar functionality that obsoletes maintaining this
                particular package.
