Endeavour Mark II File Management Suite

Note: The device info functionality has not been ported to Minix. Everything
else should work correctly though. I have no need for "managing" devices,
but if you do, you can add it yourself and send a patch :) I think it's fairly
straightforward parsing of /etc/mtab. The stat(v)fs stuff might be more tricky
though.
