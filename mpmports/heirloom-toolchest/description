To select a certain personality, combine the base personality directory
with the generic Heirloom toolchest base directory, e.g.:

PATH=/usr/5bin/posix2001:/usr/5bin:$PATH export PATH
PATH=/usr/5bin/posix:/usr/5bin:$PATH export PATH
PATH=/usr/5bin/s42:/usr/5bin:$PATH export PATH
PATH=/usr/5bin:$PATH export PATH

or with /usr/ucb:

PATH=/usr/ucb:/usr/5bin/s42:/usr/5bin:$PATH export PATH
