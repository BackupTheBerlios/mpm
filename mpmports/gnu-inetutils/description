GNU inetutils

Too much low-level stuff is missing yet from Minix and GNU inetutils are not
very portable. But I managed to get a few clients to compile with some patches.
If you need, say, an ftp server, you should look elsewhere.

clients
-------
includes:   ftp, glob, whois, logger, rcp, rsh, tftp
excludes:   ping, rlogin, talk, telnet

servers
-------
includes:
excludes:   ftpd, inetd, rexecd, rlogind, rshd, talkd, telnetd, tftpd, uucpd
