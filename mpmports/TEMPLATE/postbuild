# This is the post-build script. Do whatever you have to do after the build
# script has run. Available environment variables are:
#
# MPM_WORK          MPM work directory; rarely needed
#
# SMPM_FILES        directory where additional files reside that could be
#                   moved to the pristine sources directory for succesful
#                   compilation
#
# SMPM_PATCHES      directory containing patchfiles to be applied to the
#                   pristine sources
#
# SMPM_BUILDROOT    directory where the unpacked pristine sources reside
#
# SMPM_INSTALLROOT  directory where the build script should install the
#                   compiled binaries, libraries, documentation, et cetera.
#                   this is what gets packaged in the binary MPM file
#
# _arch             current architecture, e.g. i386, ppc, et cetera
#
# _os               current operating system, e.g. minix, linux, et cetera
