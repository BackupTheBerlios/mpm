* exit with exit code of _compiler!
    - preferably without the use of a temporary file to store the exit code
    - PIPESTATUS is bash only so that's out of the question

* colorize icc, suncc, et cetera
* perhaps merge all colorizers as they share quite a lot of code
    - problem with that is that cc can be anything, so it is impossible
      to distinguish between compilers when multiple compilers are
      installed
