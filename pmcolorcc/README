pmcolorcc contains several small scripts that colorize the output of
different compilers.

Currently, the following compilers are supported:

gcc/g++         GNU C/C++ Compiler
cc/acd          ACK (Amsterdam Compiler Kit)
suncc/sunCC     Sun Studio C/C++ Compiler
icc             Intel C/C++ Compiler

Adding additional compilers is pretty easy. Just copy one of the other
colorizers and adjust the sed-rules.


Requirements:

A terminal capable of ANSI colors


Installation:

Type 'make' and follow the instructions


Usage:

Make symbolic links in $HOME/bin and be sure that $HOME/bin is first in your
PATH. For example:

ln -s /usr/local/bin/pmcolorgcc $HOME/bin/gcc
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
which gcc

If you want to override the default settings (compiler paths, colors, ...) you
can create an rc file in your home directory:

cp /usr/local/etc/pmcolorgccrc $HOME/.pmcolorgccrc
vi $HOME/.pmcolorgccrc
