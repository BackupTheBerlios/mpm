pmcolorcc contains several small scripts that colorize the output of
different compilers.

Currently, the following compilers are supported:

gcc/g++         GNU C/C++ Compiler
cc/acd          ACK (Amsterdam Compiler Kit)
suncc/sunCC     Sun Studio C/C++ Compiler
icc             Intel C/C++ Compiler

Adding additional compilers is pretty easy. Just copy one of the other
colorizers and adjust the sed-rules.
