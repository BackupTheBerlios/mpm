Tiny Console Tetris, Copyright (c) 2006, Ivo van Poorten

tctetris is a very small implementation of the well-known tetris game which
runs entirely on the console. It does not depend on termcap, curses or ncurses
but uses ANSI escape sequences to move the cursor around an set colors et
cetera. Hence, you need an ANSI capable terminal to run this game, for example
the Minix and Linux console or an xterm.

The rules are straightforward. Create solid horizontal lines by turning the
shapes before they reach the bottom and prevent the screen from filling up.
For every solid line, you score one point. If you drop a shape prematurely,
you score one point for every position it drops. If you create four solid lines
at once, the speed decreases by one, except when the speed is already at its
lowest setting. There are 13 speed settings and 100 levels ;-) Have fun!
