libdummywc is meant for Minix 3.1.2a and perhaps later versions.

This is a dummy library that "implements" a few wc* functions through
their non-wc counterparts, i.e. wcsncpy --> strncpy

This only works if you are SURE that no wide character strings are used
throughout the application, i.e. the application was configured with
--disable-nls but nevertheless still calls wc* functions on 7-bit ASCII
strings. One example of such application/library is libXaw from Xorg 7.1.

Not sure if this even validates for having a license, so consider this
"code" public domain.
